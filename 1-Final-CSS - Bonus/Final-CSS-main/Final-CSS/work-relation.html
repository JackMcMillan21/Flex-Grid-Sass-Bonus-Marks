                    <h2>Final Game Assesment</h2>
                    <p>
                        The image that you are seing on the right hand side is from a game that me and another student
                        made
                        from scratch and with no external help at all. For this game we were asked to make any game with
                        small
                        amounts of requirements and we
                        were given two straight weeks. For this project, my partner and I recreated a well-known game
                        called "super smash bros" and it was quite a success. I learned a lot from this project some
                        examples being how to use
                        parallel arrays, for each loop's, method return functions etc. I am extremely proud of this
                        project
                        because my partner and I spent a lot of time in and outside of school on it and it turned out
                        very well.

                    <h2>3D Modelling Project 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this second project every Friday we would have an opportunity to work on whatever we wanted.
                        I decided that
                        I wanted to learn about 3d animation. The software I used was called
                        blender and I learned a majority of the basic animation principles when relating to humans and
                        how they move.
                        Although I had great successes throughout the time I spent on this project, it unfortunatly
                        ended in
                        a defeat when I wasn't able to make the upper half of the body move in the way that I had
                        planned.
                        Although it failed I learned from my mistakes and was able to learn how to use a majority of the
                        animation
                        tools very fluently. I am very proud of this project because I think that blender can be very
                        difficult to
                        use when people are first getting introduced to it like me, but I feel that I was able to get
                        the hang of it quite quickly.

                    <h2>3D Modelling Project 2</h2>
                    <p>
                        As stated above every Friday we have an opportunity to work on whatever we wanted and this
                        is the second project that I worked on. Instead of continuing to learn about animation, I
                        thought that I would go more down the path of 3d modelling. I used the same software as before
                        and I continue to be comfortable with it. I learned how to use an abundant amount of the
                        tools that the software provides but I did this over the course of 6 weeks. I wouldn't have
                        nearly
                        enough
                        time to learn all of the tools. I am very proud of this second project because I feel like I was
                        able to
                        not
                        follow a tutorial and use my skills by just knwoing how the tools operate the make something
                        quite
                        significant. 
                        I also spent a lot of time outside of class on it because I enjoyed it this type of modelling so
                        much.

                    <h2>Lift Certificate</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lastly I will be talking about a certificate I revieved proving my ethics when it comes to any
                        situation I approach.
                        This was not much of a project as it was a course. It was something that I went through at
                        school
                        through a class
                        I was taking at the time called life works.It is a very helpful to
                        students and I defiantly think that this is an important course in high school. This course has
                        taught me a
                        lot about ethics and ethical decision-making overall. I think that I could use the skills that
                        I've
                        learned from this course to my advantage in the workplace, school, home etc. I am proud of this
                        certification because it was lots of work going through this course with assignments and a final
                        project.
